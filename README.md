## The Conceit

I often think to myself, "If I were in charge, this is how I'd do things." I'd like to share these ideas with friends and present a coherent approach. The problem is, there isn't just one true way to do everything: the context matters. So this document is based on a hypothetical software coaching company that has successfully achieved some level of success and growth to the point that my ideas about organization and policy actually matter.

## Outline of Topics

Topics I intend to address:

- Distinct purpose
- Exclusion criteria
- Decision-making and conflict resolution
- Aligned incentives
- Transparency
- Horizontal growth
- Translating resources into outcomes
