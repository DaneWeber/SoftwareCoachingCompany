## The Conceit

I often think to myself, "If I were in charge, this is how I'd do things." I'd like to share these ideas with friends and present a coherent approach. The problem is, there isn't just one true way to do everything: the context matters.

This document is based on a hypothetical coaching company for software development that has achieved some level of success and growth to the point that my ideas about organization and policy actually matter.

## Company Mission

_We help humanity benefit from software through the humane and sustainable sharing of wisdom, craft, and code._

- We understand software to be universal to humanity.
  - Software is a confluence of language and technology.
    - Language captures ideas in symbolic form and enables communication and coordination between people across space and time.
    - Technology multiplies the effects of human efforts and is shareable such that people can build on the learning of others.
    - Software directly translates language into mechanical effects.
  - Software codifies human knowledge.
  - Civilization now depends on software.
- We want the benefits of software to be universal.
  - This includes the growth and maintenance of FOSS which is a public good.
  - This includes the effective application of software for the benefit human groups and organizations.
  - This includes the ability of people to inspect, understand, and influence the software that affects them.
- There are better ways of writing and maintaining software.
  - We want to share those better ways to avoid wasting human energy and the resources of the world.
