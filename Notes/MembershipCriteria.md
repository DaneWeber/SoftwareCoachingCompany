# Notes on Membership Criteria

[Ron Quartel](http://www.fast-agile.com/about) recommended a [podcast interview with Miki Kashtan](https://leadermorphosis.co/ep-37-miki-kashtan-on-the-three-shifts-needed-for-self-managing-organisations-to-thrive) about Nonviolent Communication and self-managing organisations. While there is so much to dive into on this topic, the particular idea of "Exclusion Criteria" spoke to me, especially because exclusion criteria that is so clear that people simply _know_ whether they belong not only changes the game for hiring/firing, but also provides real direction and leadership on the vision of the group.

I changed the title ever so slightly because I wanted to positively identify the criteria for membership.
